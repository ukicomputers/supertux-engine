# supertux-engine
Clone of a SuperTux level renderer written in PyGame. Level files are specified with JSON files (located in `levels` folder).<br>`main.py` is just a single level render main code for everything (collisions, player drawings and other things).

## Requirements
`pygame` library is needed (`pip install pygame`).

## License
Since the main licenses for sprites and music are located in SuperTux, you can refer to them by seeing it's [license](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) and general [repository](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux).

Code is licensed with GPLv3 (same as SuperTux).
